# The grammar corresponding to the test analysis. We expect it to be normalized
# as follows:
#
# Flow :: -
#       | Flow assign
#       | Temp2[i] ret[i]
# Temp1[i] :: Flow param[i]
# Temp2[i] :: Temp1[i] Flow
#
# Compare the generated code with the manually written code in the test analysis
# file.

Flow :: -
      | Flow assign
      | Flow param[i] Flow ret[i]
