The name of the sub-directory where an analysis is stored defines the format
of its input and output facts. Each sub-directory name has 4 fields, each of
which describes the cloning strategy of some program domain:

  +----- variable nodes w.r.t. field sensitivity
  |+---- variable nodes w.r.t. call sensitivity
  ||+--- object nodes (same dimension as variable nodes)
  |||+-- label nodes (same dimension as variable nodes)
  ||||
  VVVV
  oooo

The following cloning strategies are used:
  _ : no cloning
  e : node-based graph explosion
  r : index relation-based graph explosion

The analysis may not actually be sensitive on the corresponding dimensions, but
simply support that input/output format.

===============================================================================

How to read an analysis name, if formatted as 1-2-3-4:5.cfg:

1st part: field sensitivity
  i : field-(i)nsensitive
  s : fully field-(s)ensitive
      fields are the primary context-free dimension

2nd part: call sensitivity
  i : calling context-(i)nsensitive
  s : fully calling context-(s)ensitive
      call strings are the primary context-free dimension
  r : index (r)elation-based k-CFA call-string approximation
      can only appear in a sub-directory named *r**
  e : node (e)xplosion-based k-CFA call-string approximation
      can only appear in a sub-directory named *e**

3rd part: alias formulation
  p : (p)oints-to based
      points-to facts computed for each abstract object, then connected to form
      alias relations
  e : node (e)xplosion-based cloning of objects
      (for the non-primary sensitivity dimension)
      can only appear in a sub-directory named **e*
  v : intermediate (v)ariable based
      no abstract objects used, connect alias subpaths at the first common
      variable
  t : (t)ype filters, implemented as edge predicates

4th part: taint flow formulation:
  s : only (s)tart and finish of flow covered (passthroughs ignored)
  a : (a)lias piggyback
  c : (c)onditional flow annotations supported
  e : node (e)xplosion-based cloning of labels
      (for the non-primary sensitivity dimension)
      can only appear in a sub-directory named ***e
  n : (almost) full (n)esting
      no nesting support for conditional escaping trigger entry
  l : (l)imited nested taint propagation
      tainting, escaping, conditional escaping taint entry: all fields
      passthrough entry & exit: only array elements
      conditional escaping trigger entry: no nesting support

5th part: additional parameters:
  a : the analysis uses (or supports) special terminals for array operations,
      rather than constant tags on the specification
  p : PN-style matching
  b : original formulation, with no optimizations
